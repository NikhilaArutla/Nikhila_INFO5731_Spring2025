The program should include robust error handling for invalid inputs, overbooking prevention, cancellations, and corrupted CSV files. Advanced functionalities such as bulk data import/export, revenue calculation, and route popularity analysis are required. A user-friendly menu-driven interface and clear documentation should support easy navigation, scalability, and thorough testing to ensure smooth operation under various scenarios."
