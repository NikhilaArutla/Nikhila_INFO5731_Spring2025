district and got away with an estimated $ 500 million worth of precious stones and diamonds . while the rest of the city was busy celebrating romance and love , these tenacious men peeled open safe deposit box after safe deposit box , leaving excess treasure on the ground like it was garbage . when the security guard came to unlock the vault door on monday morning , he found it already opened and the vault floor littered with millions of dollars worth of diamonds , gold , semiprecious gems and other items the thieves left behind . everyone was stunned . despite the heavy security , the unimaginable happened . drag queens , fake beards , chocolates : notable diamond heists ten years later , it happened again . on monday night , a well-organized group of armed men dressed like police officers swarmed a passenger plane in brussels , belgium , and made off with about $ 50 million worth of diamonds . it just shows -- you can never let down your guard when it comes to diamonds . the problem with safeguarding diamonds is that they are so incredibly valuable and easy to resell that thieves will always be trying to get their hands on them . it is important for those tasked with securing such high value items to never grow complacent . the more valuable a target , the more likely that there will be those out there biding their time and learning the mechanics of the security measures in order to break them . once a heist occurs , it is nearly impossible to trace back the stolen diamonds . just as banks have problems with robbers desiring their cash , those in the diamond trade have to constantly prepare for the possibility that one day , after years and years of nothing happening , they will be under attack . in the 2003 heist , the vault was thought to be impregnable in part because of the surrounding high security of the antwerp diamond district . but the clever thieves bypassed the security by entering through the rear of the building that held the vault via a garage door that opened outside the secure portion of the district . after that , they had to beat a combination lock , key lock , heat detector , motion detector , light detector and more . monday 's heist involved a transfer of diamonds from the antwerp diamond district to the brussels airport . i 've seen these diamond runs before . a brinks armored truck arrives in nearby antwerp , passes through the extensive security surrounding the diamond district and picks up cash and diamonds . then it takes the valued goods to the brussels airport to be flown to diamond centers around the world . key elements of the security in these runs include the armored truck , which would be difficult , although not impossible to neutralize . the runs are also accompanied by police officers equipped with submachine guns and body armor . antwerp 's diamond district , much like brussels ' airport , has hundreds of closed circuit cameras , armed guards and barriers against unauthorized vehicles as part of its security measures . the thieves must have watched and noticed that as impressive as this security looks , there were holes . or perhaps they had an inside source that alerted them to a vulnerability . once the trucks arrived at the airport with their police escort , they would make their delivery and then leave . so for a very small window of time , only unarmed cargo workers would guard the jewels . those transporting diamonds assumed that the security at a major international airport would be enough to protect their goods . now they know they ca n't assume anything . the thieves just needed to get around all the normal airport security that prevented them from walking into the airport and getting to the plane through the front door . there were holes in the airport 's security wide enough to drive a truck through , and that 's literally what happened . the thieves cut some fences , drove onto the tarmac , grabbed the diamonds and got out fast . in the age of terrorism , it is shocking that armed men were able to make it onto a tarmac right beside an airplane filled with passengers . the thieves took advantage of this assumption by everyone involved that an airport tarmac is a safe place . the people transporting the diamonds should have made sure they were secure until the moment the plane lifted off the ground and maybe even have someone on board to protect them in flight . instead , the armed police who brought the diamonds to the airport were gone by the time the robbers drove up to the plane . anytime that you are protecting something of enormous value , you need to stay aware that there are smart , talented people who will spend the time needed to carefully dissect the security and exploit any weakness in it . those protecting diamonds need to be running scenarios where they imagine ways to negate or bypass their own security . perhaps outside experts -- or teams -- could be used , one side trying to achieve a criminal objective , while the other thinks of ways of beefing up security to prevent them . ten years after the world-record-setting diamond heist in antwerp , this week 's diamond robbery is a sharp reminder

ef735e9e8eb67794ee7c21bcab5015aa3b1aa7c9,"new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , prompted the u.s. to take sensible security measures and launch a justified counterattack against al qaeda , says analyst fareed zakaria . but he says they also led to an overreaction that continues today . zakaria argues the organization behind the attacks , al qaeda , has been greatly diminished by the u.s. response to 9/11 and by growing opposition to the group in the muslim world : `` all these trends have worked to further diminish the threat al qaeda poses to us . we 're in a strange situation where the right does n't want to acknowledge it because it would suggest we do n't need to be in quite this much of a war footing and ... the left seems reluctant to accept some of this because it suggests that , god forbid , george w. bush might have done something right . `` as a result of our political dysfunction , we have lost the ability to have a rational conversation about 9/11 , '' zakaria said . the author and host of cnn 's `` fareed zakaria gps '' spoke to cnn on wednesday . here is an edited transcript : cnn : is the u.s. safer today than before 9/11 ? fareed zakaria : there 's no question we 're safer . look , 9/11 changed the way in which we viewed the problem of terrorism and islamic radicalism , and we 've gotten attentive to both . first of all , there have been huge measures taken -- a series of very simple , sensible measures that decrease the likelihood of anything like 9/11 happening . sealing the cockpit door , by itself , means that a plane can never be used as a missile and things like that ... the security measures have made it much more difficult for high-value targets to be vulnerable in quite the way they were . the second part is that we have gone after these al qaeda and associated groups quite vigorously , chasing them around the mountains of afghanistan of course but also tracking their money . and those things collectively have made a big difference , and there 's no question in my mind , we 're safer . now we can begin to ask ourselves whether we have overdone the countermeasures , whether the tens of billions of dollars that have been added year after year to the intelligence budget , to the homeland security budget have been all necessary or are we on a kind of autopilot where no request for homeland security can ever be denied , and it has become part of the gargantuan pork barrel projects in washington . cnn : you 've written that we 've overreacted to 9/11 and al qaeda . in what way do you think that 's the case ? zakaria : i mean it in two senses . we did n't spend a lot of time in the year after 9/11 -- once we had taken it on , once we had started chasing these people around the world , measures which i strongly supported then and still strongly support -- whether that had been effective and whether we had broken up the organization and made it far more difficult for them to operate . and therefore , what was the real nature of the threat going forward ? i think it 's clear that al qaeda is a much-diminished force . it has the power to inspire a series of local organizations around the world , but it has very little power to direct these high-profile terrorist attacks itself . the reaction to my point that al qaeda is weaker than we think has surprised me only because i 've made this point since 2004 , and i 've made it repeatedly . cnn : why do you think many people have not agreed with that point ? zakaria : i do think we have a tendency in the united states to underestimate the evil intentions of our enemies , but overestimate their capacity , their capabilities . what we now know , based on all the declassified documents we have available is that in the 1970s and '80s , the u.s. was massively overestimating the military capacity of the soviet union . cnn : in what way ? zakaria : if you look at every measure , from bombers to missiles , on almost every count , we massively overestimated their capacity to modernize , their capacity to build up , and as a result we had created a much , much larger military-industrial complex than would have been necessary to combat the actual soviet threat rather than the one we perceived . similarly with saddam hussein , the intelligence agencies were absolutely convinced that what we faced was a very powerful state that was acquiring nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , which proved to be largely untrue . when we look at al qaeda , we have to ask ourselves : what is their actual capacity to inflict harm ? the second sense in which i mean it is i do think there is a tendency within the american appropriations system for projects to become eternal and eternally expanding and this has clearly become true of homeland security . nobody wants to deny the request for more security , more measures , more procedures , all of which come with more budgets , more bureaucrats ... cnn : so what should be done now ? zakaria : this would be the right time for us to take a look and ask ourselves , in order to combat the actual threat that al qaeda poses , which is real but which is limited in some senses -- what kind of intelligence apparatus do we need , what kind of homeland security apparatus do we need and how much can we do in terms in reallocating , reorganizing and reinventing these national security agencies rather than constantly piling up layer upon layer . we now have 15 different intelligence agencies , we have 15 different organizations tracking the money that terrorists are moving around . it 's almost as though we took the entire cold war bureaucracy and rather than scaling it down and reconfiguring it to meet this new set of unconventional threats , we just layered on top of the mountains of cold war bureaucracy another set of mountains of terrorism bureaucracy , never mind that the cold war is over ... this is not a way to run a serious national security policy . and the greatest danger here of course is that unlike the cold war , unlike world war ii , this is not a war that has a clean ending , so you can not set a point at which we would demobilize and therefore get rid of some of this apparatus . this is a kind of existential reality that the united states has to deal with , the possibility of terrorism , the possibility of radical groups being able to inflict harm on an open society , so we 've got to ask ourselves is this the normal national security state we want to live with . cnn : was the concept of a `` war on terror '' mistaken ? zakaria : i do n't know if i would quibble with it that much . ... the problem of course is that terrorism is a tactic , you ca n't declare war against a tactic . but in general it conveyed the idea that we needed to go on the offense and we needed to chase these guys around the world , we needed to track their money . i have no problem with any of that ... the problem is you can fight a war but you also need to actively gauge the strength of your opponent , and if you think he 's 25 feet tall vs. five feet tall , that 's important . that 's a huge misdiagnosis of the problem ... cnn : why do you think people have missed the change in al qaeda 's capabilities ? zakaria : we 're not looking at trends within the islamic world where al qaeda has been politically discredited , trends that are taking place within the jihadi community , where prominent jihadis have broken with al qaeda . the reality is that al qaeda has been unable to organize a single attack -lsb- against a major target in recent years -rsb- , the reality is that when smaller local groups plan terrorist attacks all they can attack are local targets like cafes or train stations and thus kill locals , further alienating the local population and discrediting and delegitimizing al qaeda and its associated groups . cnn : nine years after 9/11 , why is the debate about islam and terrorism fiercer than it 's ever been ? zakaria : what 's more strange is that it feels as though it 's a debate that 's taking place without the intervening nine years . sometimes the debate seems as though it could have been taking place in 2002 , without noticing all these trends that i 've been describing . 9/11 was a wake-up call for america , but it also was a wake-up call for a lot of people in the muslim world . in the early months after 9/11 , and i wrote about this at the time , there was a sense in the muslim world that while they might not have approved of the attacks , they understood the anti-americanism that lay behind it . that kind of totally irresponsible and pernicious implicit support for islamic radicalism has worn very thin in the last nine years . cnn : why has radicalism lost support ? zakaria : people who felt that way in indonesia , in jordan , even in palestine have realized that these guys -lsb- al qaeda -rsb- are as opposed to the secular regimes of indonesia , jordan and in the palestinian authority as they are to the united states and when they attack indonesia and jordan , they kill innocent indonesians and jordanians , innocent muslims by the way . that reality has also produced a kind of rethinking about islamic extremism that has been very important . i should emphasize that it is not enough and there needs to be more persistent condemnation of radicalism and violence but there 's no question , and the polling data make this clear , the number of fatwas issued against al qaeda and osama bin laden make this clear -- there has been a huge shift in the muslim world over the last nine years . cnn : finally , imam feisal abdul rauf is reaffirming his plans to proceed with cordoba house , the controversial islamic center near ground zero . what do you think of that ? zakaria : this is to be a community center that will have a swimming pool , meeting rooms , athletic facilities , modeled after the 92nd street y . it will have jews and christians and muslims on its board , it will have prayer rooms for jews and christians as well as muslims . it will have both physical spaces and programs to encourage interfaith dialogue . now to me that sounds like precisely the american answer to muslim radicalism , to affirm a muslim-led process of interfaith dialogue , of tolerance for other religions ... the plan here is to build a center that is really trying to bring people together , this is such an american response to intolerance , extremism and violence . it is about inclusion , dialogue and respect for other faiths .","<s> 9/11 led u.s. to

the evil intentions of our enemies  but overestimate their capacity  their capabilities  what we now know  based on all the declassified documents we have available is that in the 1970s and 80s  the us was massively overestimating the military capacity of the soviet union  cnn  in what way  zakaria  if you look at every measure  from bombers to missiles  on almost every count  we massively overestimated their capacity to modernize  their capacity to build up  and as a result we had created a much  much larger militaryindustrial complex than would have been necessary to combat the actual soviet threat rather than the one we perceived  similarly with saddam hussein  the intelligence agencies were absolutely convinced that what we faced was a very powerful state that was acquiring nuclear  biological and chemical weapons  which proved to be largely untrue  when we look at al qaeda  we have to ask ourselves  what is their actual capacity to inflict harm  the second sense in which i mean it is i do think there is a tendency within the american appropriations system for projects to become eternal and eternally expanding and this has clearly become true of homeland security  nobody wants to deny the request for more security  more measures  more procedures  all of which come with more budgets  more bureaucrats  cnn  so what should be done now  zakaria  this would be the right time for us to take a look and ask ourselves  in order to combat the actual threat that al qaeda poses  which is real but which is limited in some senses  what kind of intelligence apparatus do we need  what kind of homeland security apparatus do we need and how much can we do in terms in reallocating  reorganizing and reinventing these national security agencies rather than constantly piling up layer upon layer  we now have 15 different intelligence agencies  we have 15 different organizations tracking the money that terrorists are moving around  it s almost as though we took the entire cold war bureaucracy and rather than scaling it down and reconfiguring it to meet this new set of unconventional threats  we just layered on top of the mountains of cold war bureaucracy another set of mountains of terrorism bureaucracy  never mind that the cold war is over  this is not a way to run a serious national security policy  and the greatest danger here of course is that unlike the cold war  unlike world war ii  this is not a war that has a clean ending  so you can not set a point at which we would demobilize and therefore get rid of some of this apparatus  this is a kind of existential reality that the united states has to deal with  the possibility of terrorism  the possibility of radical groups being able to inflict harm on an open society  so we ve got to ask ourselves is this the normal national security state we want to live with  cnn  was the concept of a  war on terror  mistaken  zakaria  i do nt know if i would quibble with it that much   the problem of course is that terrorism is a tactic  you ca nt declare war against a tactic  but in general it conveyed the idea that we needed to go on the offense and we needed to chase these guys around the world  we needed to track their money  i have no problem with any of that  the problem is you can fight a war but you also need to actively gauge the strength of your opponent  and if you think he s 25 feet tall vs five feet tall  that s important  that s a huge misdiagnosis of the problem  cnn  why do you think people have missed the change in al qaeda s capabilities  zakaria  we re not looking at trends within the islamic world where al qaeda has been politically discredited  trends that are taking place within the jihadi community  where prominent jihadis have broken with al qaeda  the reality is that al qaeda has been unable to organize a single attack lsb against a major target in recent years rsb  the reality is that when smaller local groups plan terrorist attacks all they can attack are local targets like cafes or train stations and thus kill locals  further alienating the local population and discrediting and delegitimizing al qaeda and its associated groups  cnn  nine years after 911  why is the debate about islam and terrorism fiercer than it s ever been  zakaria  what s more strange is that it feels as though it s a debate that s taking place without the intervening nine years  sometimes the debate seems as though it could have been taking place in 2002  without noticing all these trends that i ve been describing  911 was a wakeup call for america  but it also was a wakeup call for a lot of people in the muslim world  in the early months after 911  and i wrote about this at the time  there was a sense in the muslim world that while they might not have approved of the attacks  they understood the antiamericanism that lay behind it  that kind of totally irresponsible and pernicious implicit support for islamic radicalism has worn very thin in the last nine years  cnn  why has radicalism lost support  zakaria  people who felt that way in indonesia  in jordan  even in palestine have realized that these guys lsb al qaeda rsb are as opposed to the secular regimes of indonesia  jordan and in the palestinian authority as they are to the united states and when they attack indonesia and jordan  they kill innocent indonesians and jordanians  innocent muslims by the way  that reality has also produced a kind of rethinking about islamic extremism that has been very important  i should emphasize that it is not enough and there needs to be more persistent condemnation of radicalism and violence but there s no question  and the polling data make this clear  the number of fatwas issued against al qaeda and osama bin laden make this clear  there has been a huge shift in the muslim world over the last nine years  cnn  finally  imam feisal abdul rauf is reaffirming his plans to proceed with cordoba house  the controversial islamic center near ground zero  what do you think of that  zakaria  this is to be a community center that will have a swimming pool  meeting rooms  athletic facilities  modeled after the 92nd street y  it will have jews and christians and muslims on its board  it will have prayer rooms for jews and christians as well as muslims  it will have both physical spaces and programs to encourage interfaith dialogue  now to me that sounds like precisely the american answer to muslim radicalism  to affirm a muslimled process of interfaith dialogue  of tolerance for other religions  the plan here is to build a center that is really trying to bring people together  this is such an american response to intolerance  extremism and violence  it is about inclusion  dialogue and respect for other faiths,s 911 led us to

'' so who is this guy , and how did he wind up getting captured , anyway ? friends describe him as a trustworthy and outgoing world traveler who joined the army in 2008 . how he ended up captive remains a bit of a mystery . u.s. officials have declined to go into detail , but soldiers in his platoon say he was pulling guard duty when he put down his weapons and walked off base . he reportedly had sent e-mails to his parents denouncing u.s. activities in afghanistan , according to 2012 reporting by late rolling stone reporter michael hastings . what are the soldiers who served with him saying ? bluntly , they resent any talk of bergdahl as a hero . they say he 's a deserter who should be put on trial , especially in light of the deaths of at least six u.s. soldiers killed while looking for him . `` i was pissed off then and i am even more so now with everything going on , '' said matt vierkant , who was in the same platoon as bergdahl . `` bowe bergdahl deserted during a time of war and his fellow americans lost their lives searching for him . '' `` i do n't understand why we 're trading prisoners at gitmo for somebody who deserted during a time of war , which is an act of treason , '' vierkant said . are they right ? was he a deserter ? u.s. officials are n't saying that , at least not directly . when asked about the issue sunday , defense secretary chuck hagel sidestepped the question . `` our first priority is assuring his well-being and his health and getting him reunited with his family , '' hagel said . `` other circumstances that may develop and questions , those will be dealt with later . '' on monday , pentagon spokesman adm. john kirby said u.s. officials `` still do n't have a complete picture of what caused him to leave his base that night . '' `` but let 's not forget , he was held captive as a prisoner for five years . five years by himself , '' kirby said . `` that 's a pretty high price to pay for whatever impelled him to walk off that base . '' so what 's next for him ? he 's at an american military hospital in germany being evaluated by doctors and facing a lengthy repatriation and reintegration process . he 's in stable condition `` receiving treatment for conditions that require hospitalization , '' landstuhl regional medical center said in a statement . beyond saying he requires attention to `` dietary and nutrition needs , '' the hospital did n't elaborate , citing medical privacy requirements . `` the landstuhl staff is sensitive to what sgt. bergdahl has been through and will proceed with his reintegration at a pace with which he is comfortable , '' the hospital said . those in charge of treating bergdahl are working to build up his confidence in them , a senior defense department official said , noting that bergdahl has n't been able to trust anyone for five years . doctors in germany are evaluating his health and whether he 's ready to be transported , said arwen consaul , a spokeswoman for u.s. army south . once doctors give the ok , a receiving team will travel there to facilitate his transport to lackland air force base in san antonio , texas . from there , he 'll head to the san antonio military medical center , where a room is already ready for bergdahl and a support team is standing by , consaul said . he has n't yet talked to his family , kirby said . `` that will obviously occur , but it wo n't occur until i think everybody believes it 's the right time , '' he said . the first meeting between bergdahl and his parents may only last minutes , consaul said , depending on what psychologists recommend . once in the united states , she said , bergdahl 's daily routine will focus on four key areas : medical care , psychological support , debriefings and family support . `` this is to help a person who has had no control of their own life for years now regain that control step by step , '' she said . is it true he 's having trouble speaking english ? why ? yes , according to a senior defense department official , but the reasons for it are n't clear . it may be that he has n't used english since he was captured , instead speaking to his captors in pashtun , the local language . roy hallums , a private contractor held by iraqi insurgents for 10 months , said he did n't have trouble readjusting to english , but said he could n't talk for a while because he had been forced to stay silent under threat of death . `` it 's like your vocal chords are like your muscles in your arms . if they do n't get any use , they get out of shape , '' he told cnn 's `` new day . '' what about these detainees the u.s. let go ? should we worry about them ? according to senior u.s. officials , they 're mid - to high-level officials from the taliban regime that ruled afghanistan when the united states invaded the country . they include figures said to be linked to the late terror leader osama bin laden , his al qaeda terror network and to abuses inside afghanistan during the taliban 's rule . but kirby said monday that u.s. officials have received assurances from qatari officials that the men `` were not going to pose a direct threat to the national security of the united states . '' he declined to go into detail , but according to a senior defense official , they will be subject to qatari supervision and a one-year travel ban . should we expect any more prisoner swaps or releases ? there are n't any other u.s. military personnel being held , so there wo n't be any more swaps involving troops , at least . but it 's possible that bergdahl 's release presages a broader release of afghan citizens from guantanamo bay , said cnn terrorism analyst peter bergen . `` at the end of hostilities , both sides typically swap prisoners , and we 're coming to the end of conventional hostilities between these two groups , '' he said . the state department said monday that the swap for bergdahl does n't set a precedent for other detained u.s. military or diplomatic personnel , like former state department contractor alan gross in cuba or korean-american missionary kenneth bae in north korea . `` we look at each case differently , '' state department spokeswoman jen psaki told reporters . bergdahl `` is a member of the military who was detained during an armed conflict . that , obviously , is a unique circumstance , '' she said . `` in any case , whether it 's alan gross or kenneth bae or others who are detained american citizens , we take every step possible to make the case and to ... take steps to ensure their return home to the united states .

'' asked to explain those remarks , wright said , `` have you heard the whole sermon ? ... no , you have n't heard the whole sermon . that nullifies that question . '' watch as wright explains his 9/11 comments '' wright said those who heard the entire sermon would have known that he was quoting the ambassador from iraq and keeping in line with biblical principles . `` jesus said , ` do unto others as you would have them do unto you . ' you can not do terrorism on other people and expect it never to come back on you . those are biblical principles , not jeremiah wright bombastic principles , '' he said . watch as wright questions his critics ' patriotism '' wright shot back at the notion that obama has walked away from him , saying the candidate `` distanced himself from some of my remarks . ... he had to distance himself , because he 's a politician , from what the media was saying i had said , which was un-american . '' obama , when asked what he could do to keep wright 's latest comments from dragging him down , replied : `` i think people will understand that i am not perfect and that there are going to be folks in my past like rev. wright that may cause them some concern -- but that ultimately , my 20 years of service and the values that i 've written about and spoken about and promoted are their values and what they 're concerned about . and that 's what this camp has been about and what it 's going to continue to be about . '' wright said sound bites from his sermons were taken out of context and said the black religious tradition , despite its long history , is in some ways `` invisible to the dominant culture . '' the theology of the black church is a `` theology of liberation , it is a theology of transformation and it is ultimately a theology of reconciliation , '' he said . wright 's remarks came a day after he addressed an audience of 10,000 at a dinner sponsored by the detroit chapter of the national association for the advancement of colored people . watch as wright answers his critics at the naacp event '' reiterating some of the same points from that dinner , wright said , `` being different does not mean one is deficient -- it simply means one is different , like snowflakes .

during hurricane katrina . eggers is the author of five other books , including `` what is the what , '' a finalist for the 2006 national book critics circle award . eggers is the founder and editor of mcsweeney 's , an independent publishing house based in san francisco . dave eggers writes that abdulrahman zeitoun dreamed of fishing on the syrian coast as katrina approached . -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- friday , august 26 , 2005 on moonless nights the men and boys of jableh , a dusty fishing town on the coast of syria , would gather their lanterns and set out in their quietest boats . five or six small craft , two or three fishermen in each . a mile out , they would arrange the boats in a circle on the black sea , drop their nets , and , holding their lanterns over the water , they would approximate the moon . the fish , sardines , would begin gathering soon after , a slow mass of silver rising from below . the fish were attracted to plankton , and the plankton were attracted to the light . they would begin to circle , a chain linked loosely , and over the next hour their numbers would grow . the black gaps between silver links would close until the fishermen could see , below , a solid mass of silver spinning . abdulrahman zeitoun was only thirteen when he began fishing for sardines this way , a method called lampara , borrowed from the italians . he had waited years to join the men and teenagers on the night boats , and he 'd spent those years asking questions . why only on moonless nights ? because , his brother ahmad said , on moon-filled nights the plankton would be visible everywhere , spread out all over the sea , and the sardines could see and eat the glowing organisms with ease . but without a moon the men could make their own , and could bring the sardines to the surface in stunning concentrations . you have to see it , ahmad told his little brother . you 've never seen anything like this . and when abdulrahman first witnessed the sardines circling in the black he could not believe the sight , the beauty of the undulating silver orb below the white and gold lantern light . he said nothing , and the other fishermen were careful to be quiet , too , paddling without motors , lest they scare away the catch . they would whisper over the sea , telling jokes and talking about women and girls as they watched the fish rise and spin beneath them . a few hours later , once the sardines were ready , tens of thousands of them glistening in the refracted light , the fishermen would cinch the net and haul them in . they would motor back to the shore and bring the sardines to the fish broker in the market before dawn . he would pay the men and boys , and would then sell the fish all over western syria -- lattakia , baniyas , damascus . the fishermen would split the money , with abdulrahman and ahmad bringing their share home . their father had passed away the year before and their mother was of fragile health and mind , so all funds they earned fishing went toward the welfare of the house they shared with ten siblings . abdulrahman and ahmad did n't care much about the money , though . they would have done it for free . thirty-four years later and thousands of miles west , abdulrahman zeitoun was in bed on a friday morning , slowly leaving the moonless jableh night , a tattered memory of it caught in a morning dream . he was in his home in new orleans and beside him he could hear his wife kathy breathing , her exhalations not unlike the shushing of water against the hull of a wooden boat . otherwise the house was silent . he knew it was near six o'clock , and the peace would not last . the morning light usually woke the kids once it reached their second-story windows . one of the four would open his or her eyes , and from there the movements were brisk , the house quickly growing loud . with one child awake , it was impossible to keep the other three in bed . kathy woke to a thump upstairs , coming from one of the kids ' rooms . she listened closely , praying silently for rest . each morning there was a delicate period , between six and six-thirty , when there was a chance , however remote , that they could steal another ten or fifteen minutes of sleep . but now there was another thump , and the dog barked , and another thump followed . what was happening in this house ? kathy looked to her husband . he was staring at the ceiling . the day had roared to life . the phone began ringing , today as always , before their feet hit the floor . kathy and zeitoun -- most people called him by his last name because

including  what is the what   a finalist for the 2006 national book critics circle award  eggers is the founder and editor of mcsweeney s  an independent publishing house based in san francisco  dave eggers writes that abdulrahman zeitoun dreamed of fishing on the syrian coast as katrina approached  lrb cnn rrb  friday  august 26  2005 on moonless nights the men and boys of jableh  a dusty fishing town on the coast of syria  would gather their lanterns and set out in their quietest boats  five or six small craft  two or three fishermen in each  a mile out  they would arrange the boats in a circle on the black sea  drop their nets  and  holding their lanterns over the water  they would approximate the moon  the fish  sardines  would begin gathering soon after  a slow mass of silver rising from below  the fish were attracted to plankton  and the plankton were attracted to the light  they would begin to circle  a chain linked loosely  and over the next hour their numbers would grow  the black gaps between silver links would close until the fishermen could see  below  a solid mass of silver spinning  abdulrahman zeitoun was only thirteen when he began fishing for sardines this way  a method called lampara  borrowed from the italians  he had waited years to join the men and teenagers on the night boats  and he d spent those years asking questions  why only on moonless nights  because  his brother ahmad said  on moonfilled nights the plankton would be visible everywhere  spread out all over the sea  and the sardines could see and eat the glowing organisms with ease  but without a moon the men could make their own  and could bring the sardines to the surface in stunning concentrations  you have to see it  ahmad told his little brother  you ve never seen anything like this  and when abdulrahman first witnessed the sardines circling in the black he could not believe the sight  the beauty of the undulating silver orb below the white and gold lantern light  he said nothing  and the other fishermen were careful to be quiet  too  paddling without motors  lest they scare away the catch  they would whisper over the sea  telling jokes and talking about women and girls as they watched the fish rise and spin beneath them  a few hours later  once the sardines were ready  tens of thousands of them glistening in the refracted light  the fishermen would cinch the net and haul them in  they would motor back to the shore and bring the sardines to the fish broker in the market before dawn  he would pay the men and boys  and would then sell the fish all over western syria  lattakia  baniyas  damascus  the fishermen would split the money  with abdulrahman and ahmad bringing their share home  their father had passed away the year before and their mother was of fragile health and mind  so all funds they earned fishing went toward the welfare of the house they shared with ten siblings  abdulrahman and ahmad did nt care much about the money  though  they would have done it for free  thirtyfour years later and thousands of miles west  abdulrahman zeitoun was in bed on a friday morning  slowly leaving the moonless jableh night  a tattered memory of it caught in a morning dream  he was in his home in new orleans and beside him he could hear his wife kathy breathing  her exhalations not unlike the shushing of water against the hull of a wooden boat  otherwise the house was silent  he knew it was near six oclock  and the peace would not last  the morning light usually woke the kids once it reached their secondstory windows  one of the four would open his or her eyes  and from there the movements were brisk  the house quickly growing loud  with one child awake  it was impossible to keep the other three in bed  kathy woke to a thump upstairs  coming from one of the kids  rooms  she listened closely  praying silently for rest  each morning there was a delicate period  between six and sixthirty  when there was a chance  however remote  that they could steal another ten or fifteen minutes of sleep  but now there was another thump  and the dog barked  and another thump followed  what was happening in this house  kathy looked to her husband  he was staring at the ceiling  the day had roared to life  the phone began ringing  today as always  before their feet hit the floor  kathy and zeitoun  most people called him by his last name because they could nt pronounce his first  ran a company  zeitoun a painting contractor llc  and every day their crews  their clients  everyone with a phone and their number  seemed to think that once

'' after an initial presentation to the public in 2008, when rubenstein got the document at a sotheby's auction for more than $ 20 million, it was taken off display for replacement of the old, unappealing box made out of aluminum and glass, with a green fabric liner. the new display box, crafted from aircraft-quality metal, is filled with argon gas to minimize deterioration of the parchment on which the handwritten latin provisions of the magna carta were first inscribed in 1297. the document seems to float above the floor of the display case, just below special glass that blocks damaging ultraviolet light and minimizes glare from subdued external lighting that will be used to illuminate the display. `` if we could read medieval latin, it would be perfectly legible, '' said catherine nicholson, one of the ranking conservators who led the yearlong restoration and re-encasement project at the national archives. she said they were able to repair damaged sections of the parchment and have confirmed certain letters in the text by using special photography and lighting. `` we have every reason to believe that 800 years from now, they will still be in fabulous shape, '' she concluded. engineers from the national institutes of standards and technology carried out the specifications of the national archives in building the display case. rubenstein took the opportunity to explain the significance fo the magna carta and why he hopes the public display will help people understand american history. `` this became the law of the land of england and remains the law of the land in england, '' he began, noting that those who came to the colonies in america considered themselves englishmen with the same rights as those at home. when royalty said the colonists did not enjoy equal rights, it set the stage for american independence. the founding fathers affirmed many elements of english law in establishing the united states. `` our whole government is based on no taxation without representation, '' rubenstein noted. `` we have the right to habeus corpus ; we have punishment in proportion to the crime, trial by jury '' and other fundamental principles originally requested nearly 800 years ago by the lords of the king of england. `` if you read the early writings of hamilton and jefferson and adams and madison, many times, they say ` it's because of the magna carta that we're doing this,''' he said. only 17 copies of the magna carta are known to be in existence. fifteen of them are in british institutions, one is in the australian parliament, according to rubenstein, `` and this is the only one in private hands, '' he said. `` ross perot bought this in the early 1980s, '' rubenstein said, describing some of the previous ownership of his copy. he said perot had purchased it from a family that held it for more than 500 years but had fallen on hard times and sold it to raise money. rubenstein is well-known within philanthropic circles. in recent weeks, he donated more than $ 7 million to help repair the washington monument from last summer's earthquake. he also owns a copy of the emancipation proclamation, on display in the oval office of the white house, `` and i've lent a copy of the declaration of independence to the state department, '' he said. `` everybody in life has certain things that they like, '' he said, `` and i guess one of the things i like is buying these documents and owning them. '' rubenstein suggested that it is satisfying to have invested in history, `` but you can't be buried with these documents, as far as i know. so you can assume that the appropriate place will see these documents when i'm not on this earth.

'' it comes on the heels of a u.n. warning last month that two years ' worth of opium is effectively `` missing , '' probably stockpiled by the taliban and criminal gangs . more than 12,000 tons of opium , which can be consumed as a narcotic itself or turned into heroin , is unaccounted for , the united nations estimated in september . it is not clear who has it or why , but the united nations speculates that criminals could be holding it as a hedge against falling prices or that insurgents or terrorists could be stockpiling it to fund attacks . the latest report claims to be the first systematic attempt to track where afghan opium ends up . see how afghan heroin reaches europe and the west '' europe and russia together consume just under half of the heroin coming out of afghanistan , the united nations concluded , and iran is by far the single largest consumer of afghan opium . afghanistan is also probably supplying an increasing share of the heroin in china -- perhaps as much as a quarter , the report said . afghanistan is by far the world 's largest producer of opium , although laos , myanmar and latin america produce small quantities , it said . the united nations found that afghanistan may be supplying more heroin to the united states and canada than had been suspected . the two north american countries consume more than twice as much heroin as latin america produces . that means either that more afghan heroin is making its way to north america than had been known or that mexico and columbia are producing more than was realized , the united nations said . the report confirmed an estimate that $ 400 million in drug profits goes to the taliban , costa said . the taliban `` are deeply involved '' in processing , in protecting farmers and in exporting , he said . the solution `` is very clear , '' he said . `` we need a much greater effort and commitment by governments to prevent drug addiction , to take care of drug addicts ... to reduce demand . '' but the popular will for change needs to increase , he said , noting that the security council in 2006 and 2007 passed resolutions inviting member states to give the names of drug traffickers to authorities so that their ability to travel can be curtailed and their assets seized . `` so far , much to my dismay , not a single name was provided to the security council , '' he said . the report offered little new in the way of possible solutions , said ethan nadelmann , founding executive director of the drug policy alliance , which promotes alternatives to the war on drugs . `` it 's very good at describing a problem , '' he said . `` but it truly is devoid of any kind of pragmatic solution , and it essentially suggests that the answer is to keep doing more of what 's failed us in the past .

supporting the moderate opposition on the ground more. even if that does substantially change the situation down the road, the way it comes across here falls a little flat, especially with some of the buildup we've seen leading into it. `` defensive '' is kind of the word here. some of what has tainted or dampened the stance that the administration has taken even in the briefing room day-to-day is that it has been pushed into a defensive stance. this was a sweeping speech that kind of covered everything and was a chance for the president to list what seemed like every accomplishment of his administration. but it came across at times as a defensive, lawyerly answer to critics. -- michelle kosinski, cnn white house correspondent 4. military action as a last resort : administration officials were aware that obama's now infamous `` singles and doubles '' comment during his recent trip to asia struck many critics as small-minded. and they intended for his west point address to place his recent foreign policy moves in the context of broader goals and values. on that count, the speech fell short of its target. the president instead delivered a familiar defense of current strategy with virtually no new policy announcements. at the core, he argued that after `` costly wars and continuing challenges at home, '' military action must be a last resort. `` i would betray my duty to you and to the country we live in if i sent you into harm's way simply because i saw a problem that needed fixing, '' he said. the president's strategy will instead continue to emphasize international partnerships and institutions. and he presented two of his most recent foreign policy challenges -- ukraine and iran -- as examples of where this strategy has worked, deterring a russian invasion in the first, and bringing tehran to the negotiating table in the second. -- jim sciutto, cnn chief national security correspondent

necessarily hold their success against them. one politician who stands out for having a comparatively unsettled financial situation is obama. yes, his $ 8.3 million is a lot of money, but he comes from an unusually impoverished background, including a period lived on food stamps. his contemporary wealth is built on a mix of his salary and royalties from his popular books. still the days of the citizen legislator are long gone. the intensity of luxury and wealth has to affect the ability of lawmakers to empathize with voters on very low salaries or none at all. it's easy to imagine that the debate over health care reform or the bush tax cuts is affected by the fact that, for many people on the hill, the former is an academic question and the latter is personally advantageous. this isn't a partisan liberal statement. the median identity of a congressman is a rich, white, middle-aged, male lawyer. there is a deficit of experience of running a business or trying to survive on welfare payments. there is a good case for another round of campaign finance reform, although citizens united will make any such effort hard to accomplish. but even if individual or corporate contributions were limited, this wouldn't affect a bigger cultural problem in contemporary washington. government is increasingly run by people who, financially, have little in common with their constituents. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of timothy stanley.

'' chinese officials were unhappy that the sanitized google.cn , which was established by google in 2006 , contained a link to the uncensored google.com , and appeared especially sensitive about the issue because of the imminent 20th anniversary of the tiananmen square protests . the redacted cable , dated may 18 and written by economic minister counselor robert luke , says u.s. diplomats had been told that `` the root of the problem was china 's politburo standing committee member -lrb- name redacted -rrb- . '' later it says : '' -lrb- name redacted -rrb- allegedly entered his own name and found results critical of him ... he also noticed the link from google.cn 's homepage to google.com , which -lrb- redacted -rrb- reportedly believes is an ` illegal site . ' '' in another apparent reference to the politburo member , the cable says he `` believes google is a ` tool ' of the usg being used to ` foment peaceful revolution in china . ' '' the new york times , which had advance access to the cables obtained by wikileaks , says that official is li changchun , who is a member of the chinese communist party 's standing politburo committee -- its highest body -- and runs the politburo 's propaganda apparatus . he subsequently asked three ministries to demand that google end its `` illegal activities , '' according to the cable . at the same time the chinese government was taking commercial steps against google , instructing state-owned telecom firms to stop doing business with the company -- `` a hard blow because mobile internet is google 's ` big bet in china , ' '' the cable added . google refused to remove the link on its chinese site , and its lawyers `` found no legal basis for china 's demands . '' the dilemma for the company was that it risked `` losing the chinese market in retaliation for maintaining its integrity and brand , '' the cable said . google had entered the chinese market on three principles : it would never disclose to the chinese government any personal information about its users or their search habits ; it would always include a disclosure notice to identify when search results had been removed due to censorship ; and it would always provide an uncensored , u.s.-hosted site , subject to u.s. law . two months later -- in july 2009 -- google 's servers were `` virally infected '' for 24 hours , amid claims that google was failing to filter out pornographic sites . the embassy 's sources , says a cable from that month , believe `` the real reason for the government 's wrath is the company 's refusal to remove a link to google.com from the google.cn website . '' the cable continued , apparently quoting a google official , : '' -lrb- redacted -rrb- said the negative press coverage and service outages have caused the company to lose market share ... -lrb- redacted -rrb- said that , faced with the continual difficulties of doing business in china , the company may even consider pulling out of the market . '' the attacks on google servers continued , with the company reporting in january of this year that it had been the victim of a sophisticated cyber attack originating from china . it said it also discovered that the `` gmail accounts of dozens of human rights activists connected with china were being routinely accessed by third parties . '' so it began redirecting users visiting google.cn to the uncensored content of google.com.hk . a us . cable written from beijing after that cyber attack said : `` a well-placed contact claims that the chinese government coordinated the recent intrusions of google systems . according to our contact , the closely held operations were directed at the politburo standing committee level . '' the cable noted : `` an appeal to nationalism seems to be the chinese government 's chosen option to counter google 's demand to provide unfiltered web content . '' an unnamed chinese contact `` stated that prc operations against google were ` one hundred percent ' political in nature and had nothing to do with removing google , with its minority market share , as a competitor to chinese search engines . '' the cable also suggested the move might backfire on the chinese authorities , apparently citing a chinese contact . `` all of a sudden , -lrb- redacted -rrb- continued , baidu -lrb- a state-owned internet search engine -rrb- looked like a boring state-owned enterprise while google ` seems very attractive , like the forbidden fruit . ' '' however , the cables suggest that the chinese leadership -- and specifically the state council information office -- believed that the internet in china could be controlled . `` through the google incident and other increased controls and surveillance , like real-name registration , they reached a conclusion : the web is fundamentally controllable , '' according to one source quoted in a cable . long before the crisis in 2009 , google was running into hostility from chinese officials . in november 2007 , china asked the u.s. government to reduce the resolution of google earth images of military , nuclear and other sensitive sites in china . chinese officials warned of `` possible ` grave consequences ' if terrorists exploit the information to harm china . '' a diplomat at the embassy said he would report the chinese request to washington , but noted that google is a private company . other cables suggest close ties between chinese state enterprises and private hackers in china . according to a cable from the u.s. secretary of state 's office written in june 2009 , the china information technology security center `` has recruited chinese hackers in support of nationally-funded ` network attack scientific research projects . ' '' one such enterprise -- topsec -- employed `` a known chinese hacker , lin yong -lrb- a.k.a. lion and owner of the honker union of china -rrb- , as senior security service engineer to manage security service and training . '' another was `` known to affiliate with xfocus , one of the few chinese hacker groups known to develop exploits to new vulnerabilities in a short period of time . '' the cable concludes : `` while links between top chinese companies and the prc are not uncommon , it illustrates the prc 's use of its ` private sector ' in support of governmental information warfare objectives , especially in its ability to gather , process , and exploit information .

'' radiation gets into the milk because it falls on grass eaten by cows . the milk does not itself absorb radiation . fda senior scientist patricia hansen also said the findings are `` minuscule '' compared to what people experience every day . washington gov. chris gregoire said tests confirmed the milk is safe to drink . `` this morning i spoke with the chief advisers for both the epa and the fda and they confirmed that these levels are minuscule and are far below levels of public health concern , including for infants and children , '' gregoire said in a statement . `` according to them , a pint of milk at these levels would expose an individual to less radiation than would a five-hour airplane flight . '' similarly , the california department of public health reassured residents that the levels do not pose a threat . `` when radioactive material is spread through the atmosphere , it drops to the ground and gets in the environment . when cows consume grass , hay , feed , and water , radioactivity will be processed and become part of the milk we drink . however , the amounts are so small they pose no threat to public health , '' the department said . at least 15 states have reported radioisotopes from japan 's crippled fukushima daiichi nuclear plant in air or water or both . no states have recommended that residents take potassium iodide , a salt that protects the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine . iodine-131 has been found in eastern states from florida to massachusetts as well as in western states like oregon , colorado , and california , according to sensors and officials in those states . none of the levels poses a risk to public health , they said . at high levels , the isotope focuses on and accumulates in a person 's thyroid gland , curran said . a medical test for thyroid health involves a person ingesting iodine-131 and undergoing a nuclear scan to examine

from consuming milk with extremely low levels of radiation  like those found in washington state and california  experts said thursday  echoing the us environmental protection agency   when we have a

this information and understand the risks   said dr wally curran  a radiation oncologist and head of emory university s winship cancer center  the federal agency said wednesday it was increasing its nationwide monitoring of radiation in milk  precipitation  drinking water  and other outlets  it already tracks radiation in those potential exposure routes through an existing network of stations across the country  results from screening samples of milk taken in the past week in spokane  washington  and in san luis obispo county  california  detected radioactive iodine  or iodine131  at a level 5000 times lower than the limit set by the us food and drug administration  officials said  at that level  a person would have to drink 1000 liters of milk to receive the same amount of radiation as a chest xray  said dr james cox  radiation oncologist at houston s md anderson cancer center  the i131 isotope has a very short halflife of about eight days  the epa said  so the level detected in milk and milk products is expected to drop relatively quickly   the good news about iodine is  it has a short halflife   said curran   it does nt dwell in any biologic system  be it an adult  a child  a cow  for any significant period of time  and at those levels there s no evidence that there s any medical significance   radiation gets into the milk because it falls on grass eaten by cows  the milk does not itself absorb radiation  fda senior scientist patricia hansen also said the findings are  minuscule  compared to what people experience every day  washington gov chris gregoire said tests confirmed the milk is safe to drink   this morning i spoke with the chief advisers for both the epa and the fda and they confirmed that these levels are minuscule and are far below levels of public health concern  including for infants and children   gregoire said in a statement   according to them  a pint of milk at these levels would expose an individual to less radiation than would a fivehour airplane flight   similarly  the california department of public health reassured residents that the levels do not pose a threat   when radioactive material is spread through the atmosphere  it drops to the ground and gets in the environment  when cows consume grass  hay  feed  and water  radioactivity will be processed and become part of the milk we drink  however  the amounts are so small they pose no threat to public health   the department said  at least 15 states have reported radioisotopes from japan s crippled fukushima daiichi nuclear plant in air or water or both  no states have recommended that residents take potassium iodide  a salt that protects the thyroid gland from radioactive iodine  iodine131 has been found in eastern states from florida to massachusetts as well as in western states like oregon  colorado  and california  according to sensors and officials in those states  none of the levels poses a risk to public health  they said  at

couple of years  how to  after reaching a certain goal  how to reset your goals and how to keep getting better   murray will be seeking to emulate one of his best friends on the tour  novak djokovic  who will be the yearend world no 1 for the second season in a row no matter what happens in london at the eightman season finale  the serbian was effusive in his praise of murray  who he first played at the age of 11  following his final defeat at flushing meadows   it is obviously nice to hear that from him  he made his big real breakthrough last year  he had one of the best years ever on the tour so he has helped inspire me in a way to keep trying to get better and believing that you can get to the top   murray said  murray s heroics earned him a rapturous welcome in his hometown of dunblane  scene of a 1996 mass shooting at the primary school which he attended  a lone gunman  thomas hamilton  killed 17 people before taking his own life  murray  eight at the time  survived by hiding in a classroom  he has revealed since that his mother judy once gave hamilton a lift in their car while he was sat in the back  a stunned community united in their grief and shock but now revel in the achievements of andy and his brother  who has won a mixed doubles title at wimbledon   i think dunblane s only maybe 9000 people and it s very closeknit  especially after the bad experiences that have happened in the town in the past   jamie said   i think for what andy s done the last few years of his career has really put a more positive light on the town and everyone s so behind him   the pair have enjoyed success as a doubles partnership  claiming two atp tour titles  but losing in the first round of this year s olympic competition  jamie has always relished the experience   to be able to play highlevel sport with your brother is always a cool thing to do  it s pretty unique as well   it s a standing joke between them that jamie is the only one to claim a wimbledon title  he won with jelena jankovic in 2007  but with andy desperate to add to his grand slam tally it s perhaps only a matter of time before that changes,s andy murray says he struggled with confidence after

'' they are n't really , they are just co-workers anyway . cnn : were contacts the key to your early success ? mr : it 's just not even worth arguing with that because it 's so far away from the truth . i ca n't run around refuting the fact that i came from a comfortable upbringing . but the fact that i had any help and connections getting into what i did is well , it 's just not true . one of my favorite `` old skool '' hip-hop records is `` i know you got soul '' by eric b. and rakim , and it 's got a classic line , `` it 's not where you 're from , it 's where you 're at '' which always applies in hip-hop . i was just a good dj who got better because of an enthusiasm for music and playing out . once people became aware of me outside that more insular hip-hop scene they were kind of like `` oh , how did he get here ? must be because of his parents . '' and they have to find something to say and that was one of the criticisms they chose . rosie tomkins and teo kermeliotis contributed to this report .","<s> grammy award-winning producer mark ronson

has worked with biggest names in music s s 34yearold from new york started as a hiphop dj before producing s s worked with amy winehouse  kanye west  duran duran among others s s currently touring and fronting his own band  the business intl s,1033,51,"1. a rare thing for a producer, he's almost as well known as some of the big name musicians he works with, but ronson's latest project sees him taking the stage with his new band the business intl.. for ronson it's not such a radical departure from his previous work or how he sees himself. `` i think we live in an era certainly where it's not unusual to be many things, especially in music, '' he told cnn. `` now i'm in a slightly more unique position of actually being an artist in the front of my own record and putting them out as well producing them, but it seems to all fit. '' described by his childhood friend sean lennon as `` very driven... you wouldn't think he's so ambitious from meeting him because he's so relaxed, '' ronson is taking his varied career and lifestyle in his stride. cnn talked to him about his musical identity and being the man with the golden rolodex. cnn : do you think of yourself as the master of collaborations? mark ronson : i just think that because my own albums are more collaborative affairs... i've got this tag of master collaborator, but i don't think it's necessarily true. if this was a report card from school, it would say `` plays well with others. '' that's one of the things that helps and more importantly i grew up liking such a wide range of music that i love working in different genres. not being stuck in one genre definitely widens the palette of the kind of people you can work with. cnn : are you affected by fame? mr : i'm sort of lucky to live in new york where i live a pretty anonymous lifestyle anyway. i'm a bit more aware of it when i come -lsb- to london -rsb- and sometimes i think i'm almost naive to think it doesn't exist. i 'd still like to think that i could just live the same life i did 3 years ago, going on the tube, or going to see a band and walking around the front to watch and realizing that i 'll probably just have to stand here and take pictures with people's camera phones, which is fun. i'm not mobbed, nobody really cares that much about my life and i just get to live it how i would otherwise. cnn : do you see yourself as responsible for making amy winehouse a star? mr : i definitely didn't make amy a star. i helped her find a great sound that really fitted well with what she wanted to do. in her songs there's a lot of heartache and remorse and regret and fire that was in a lot of music, jazz and soul of the '50s and '60s. and it was also that we gave it a modern twist... i added drums from hip-hop ; i wanted to make a modern soul record that if rza from wu tang heard he would've wanted to sample it. so if anything, i think amy is more responsible for me being where i am than maybe the other way around. watch mark ronson talking about amy winehouse's `` rehab '' cnn : are you a pragmatist or a pessimist? mr : i'm a pragmatist. the first record i produced was for this artist nikka costa. it was on mtv, there was this hype about it and everyone thought it was going to be this big thing and it came out and it really didn't do anything. and i thought that was a really good lesson in a way because it lets you know that no matter how many people come out telling you it's going to be great, it could easily come out and do nothing. cnn : you're thought of as the man with the golden rolodex. is that true? mr : the only people i know really that are bold faced names who are considered `` celebs '' are musicians. it's not likely you open up my phone and see kiera knightly and jude law. these are just musicians that i work with and a few of them happen to be famous, so people go, `` oh, your famous friends!

6a82b88de0ba92b80e6aa536ce748b0bb03fc7ba,"-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- venezuelan president hugo chavez froze diplomatic relations with colombia late tuesday , citing verbal aggressions from the neighboring south american country . venezuelan foreign minister nicolas maduro speaks to journalists on monday in caracas . the televised announcement followed declarations from the colombian government monday that anti-tank weapons purchased by venezuela ended up in the hands of the guerrilla revolutionary armed forces of colombia , known as the farc . in addition , colombian president alvaro uribe said the guerrillas were trying to buy anti-aircraft missiles . venezuela received a shipment of russian sa-24 igla shoulder-fired missiles earlier this year and showed them off at military parade in april . chavez recalled venezuela 's ambassador to colombia , as well as most of the embassy 's staff . `` leave only the lowest functionaries , '' he said . chavez also threatened to take over colombian companies operating in venezuela if colombia offends venezuela one more time . colombia 's claims are `` mistaken , '' added chavez , who called the country 's leaders `` irresponsible . '' there was no immediate reaction from the colombian government . tuesday 's developments came one day after chavez signed a military agreement with russia to buy enough bmp-3 armored fighting vehicles and t-72 tanks to double the nation 's inventory , according to the jane 's defense weekly publication . chavez said he will use the tanks in his `` western shield plan '' on the border with colombia . tensions between the two countries have been high since march 2008 , when chavez ordered tanks to the border in response to a colombian attack on farc bases in ecuador . more recently , chavez has severely criticized uribe for entering into negotiations to allow the united states to open military bases in colombia . the united states says it needs the bases because ecuador has ordered the closing of a u.s. installation there . chavez accuses the united states of wanting the bases so it can attack venezuela . analysts say chavez 's actions toward colombia are tied to his feelings toward the united states . `` chavez hates the united states and he wants to lead a group of countries that do n't pay attention to the united states , '' said myles frechette , the u.s. ambassador to colombia from 1994-97 . `` uribe is a guy who is in tune with the united states . '' frechette notes that `` colombia and venezuela have complementary economies '' and could sell more goods to each other under better conditions . jennifer mccoy , director of the americas program at the carter center , makes the same point . `` it 's a conflict between two ideologies between two countries that are mutually dependent on each other , '' she said . the latest dust-up started monday , when colombia accused venezuela of selling arms to the farc . colombian vice president francisco santos said army troops had found at-4 shoulder-fired grenades in recent raids on jungle camps used by the farc . `` this is not the first time that this happens , '' santos said . `` in several operations in which we have recovered weapons from the farc , we have found powerful munitions and powerful equipment , including anti-tank weapons , from a european country that sold them to venezuela and that turned up in the hands of the farc . '' the guerrillas were trying to buy anti-aircraft missiles , uribe said . analysts say that could change the guerrilla war 's dynamics . `` the at-4 is much less of a heavy weapon , but surface-to-air missiles would give the farc a much greater military capability , '' said anna gilmour , senior america 's analyst for the jane 's country risk consultancy group . uribe said monday that must not be allowed to happen . `` the international community must help us , '' he said . `` these bandits have historically been able to rely on many sources for armaments . we have found out through intelligence that they are now looking to buy surface-to-air weapons to use against our airplanes . '' venezuelan officials denied any involvement . `` to me it seems that this is a new attack against our government based on lies , '' venezuelan minister of the interior and justice tareck el aissami said at a news conference monday . `` we absolutely deny that our government or our institutions are providing assistance to criminal and terrorist organizations . `` it 's laughable , it sounds like a cheap film made by the american government . '' sweden probes ` serious incident ' officials in sweden , where the anti-tank weapons were made by saab bofors dynamics , verified that the at-4s were sold to venezuela in the 1980s . anders jorle , sweden 's foreign ministry spokesman , told cnn the government `` considers this as a serious incident '' and is investigating . `` we 've been in contact with colombian and venezuelan authorities to clarify how this happened , '' jorle said tuesday . `` the weapons were part of a lot sold to venezuela 20 years ago . no weapons have been exported to venezuela since 2006 . '' the swedish foreign ministry added that the swedish inspectorate of strategic products , the authority responsible for checking weapon exports , will consider not selling any more weapons to venezuela . the farc most likely acquired the at-4 grenade launchers in the past 18 months , said jane 's analyst gilmour . this is not the first time that venezuela has been tied to the farc , which has been fighting the colombian government for more than 45 years . last fall , the u.s. treasury department accused two senior venezuelan intelligence officials and a former official of providing weapons to the farc and assisting the rebels with narcotics trafficking . the u.s. identified one of the individuals as hugo armando carvajal barrios , director of venezuela 's military intelligence directorate . another individual was identified as ramon emilio rodriguez chacin , who was venezuela 's minister of interior and justice until september . rodriguez chacin was `` the venezuelan government 's main weapons contact for the farc , '' the treasury department said . `` the farc uses its proceeds from narcotics sales to purchase weapons from the venezuelan government . rodriguez chacin has held numerous meetings with senior farc members , one of which occurred at the venezuelan government 's miraflores palace in late 2007 . rodriguez chacin has also assisted the farc by trying to facilitate a $ 250 million dollar loan from the venezuelan government to the farc in late 2007 . '' computers recovered last year in the colombian attack on the farc base in ecuador showed that `` chavez has been heavily involved with the farc , '' said susan kaufman purcell , director of the center for hemispheric policy at the university of miami . `` chavez has been modeling himself more on what -lsb- former cuban leader fidel -rsb- castro used to do in terms of helping insurgencies and destabilizing countries , '' purcell said . analysts point to venezuela 's increasing militarization as a threat to stability . from 2005-07 , venezuela bought $ 4.4 billion in weapons and military hardware , including 24 sukhoi-24 aircraft , 50 combat helicopters and 100,000 ak-103 assault rifles , gilmour said . last year , russia extended a $ 1 billion credit line for further acquisitions . `` venezuela has been trying to frighten everyone in the region by buying russian weapons , '' said former u.s. envoy frechette . he said chavez has become increasingly frustrated that he does n't always get his way , such as in his relations with colombia . so he turns to the russians . analysts : chavez role in military sales in question chavez 's involvement in the sale of the anti-tank weapons to the farc is open to discussion , though . `` the more interesting question is how they got there and whether chavez had anything to do with it , '' purcell said . frechette agrees , saying , `` nobody can say this was done by chavez . '' the former envoy believes there 's a good chance that the sale was carried out by corrupt officers without chavez 's involvement . `` do n't underestimate the corruption in that country , '' he said , adding that some military officials might have `` discovered these things that have been sitting in a warehouse since the 1980s . '' whether venezuela would sell surface-to-air missiles also is open to discussion . gilmour says venezuela will want to safeguard its stockpile . `` venezuela would not want any kind of seepage because the missiles were acquired so recently and venezuela-russia relations are pretty positive at the moment , '' she said . purcell said russia might not care , pointing out that `` castro did all sorts of things that the soviets did n't like '' but still kept supporting him for decades . `` russia has a lot of different interests , '' she said . `` it 's not clear that they would walk away from the relationship .

'' no country could be totally prepared for that kind of disaster , but haiti and its people seemed to be particularly disadvantaged against mother nature 's might . click to find out more about cnn documentary `` rescued '' i immediately got on my computer and began doing research , reading about haiti 's history . admittedly , my american history dates were a bit foggy , so i tried to give myself a brief refresher . in school , we learned very early on about the abolition of slavery and abraham lincoln . but i was never taught that there was a small black nation in the caribbean that had defeated napoleon 's army in 1803 . that was the same year the french decided to sell their only other colony in the western hemisphere : louisiana . had the slaves , led by toussaint l'ouverture , not overthrown the french army in haiti , would the french have sold louisiana to the united states ? the louisiana purchase instantly doubled our country 's size . now , i have spent my time in louisiana . i graduated from louisiana state university . but i never linked these two events . i am sure historians do , but does the average american know that the haitian revolution possibly played a large role in the history of the united states of america ? so , i ask myself , had toussaint l'ouverture not lived , would america be the america it is today ? if his army and the slaves had not defeated the french , would the french have wanted to sell their only other colony , so close to haiti ? so , the earthquake made me begin to read about history and look at events a little more closely . i do not understand why a country so close to some of the richest economies in the world could be in this position . i am not a political person by nature . but it does make you wonder how politically and historically , haiti 's own government and those of nearby countries have shown no accountability . that same day , i began to get calls from many organizations , people i do business with , friends asking for financial assistance and donations . i kept responding : `` get back to me on what to do for the children . '' `` call me on what we can do with the schools . '' `` can someone find me someone dealing with the orphan situation ? '' `` are these kids going to be out on the streets being sold into god knows what ?

'' as neil and i walked upon the surface of the moon at tranquility base , we satisfied a vision held by humankind for centuries . and as inscribed on the plaque fastened to the ladder of our lander : `` we came in peace for all mankind . '' sunday will mark the 45th anniversary of the lunar landing , when neil announced , `` tranquility base here . the eagle has landed . '' it was , truly , one small step , but more steps are needed to fuel and assure america 's leadership role in deep space exploration . i 'm often asked just how lonely it was on the moon . first of all , what got us there was the tireless effort of some 400,000 people who shared a universal dream . project apollo was a unified enterprise that relied on teamwork . second , while we were farther away from terra firma than any humans had ever ventured -- with our colleague mike collins circling the moon in the command module above us -- the three of us were connected to home planet earth . close to a billion people watched and listened to our journey . in reflecting back on that thrilling , transformative time , several things come to mind . standing on that harsh , desolate , yet magnificent terrain , stealing precious moments , i looked back at earth . everything i knew and loved lay suspended on a far away and fragile blue sphere that was engulfed by the blackness of space . in the back of my mind were neil 's words about a step on the moon . imagine the great magnificence of humanity going from horse and buggy , to railroads , cars , and airplanes , to rockets -- and now walking on the moon . that is a testimonial to the progress of the creatures here on earth . i could n't have imagined anything more desolate -- knowing it had n't changed in hundreds of thousands of years . you could n't find any place like that on earth . the airlessness . brilliant sunlight illuminated the dust , which was everywhere . and the horizon , visibly curving away in the distance , was so clear because no pollution obscured it . walking across that landscape was much easier than we had thought it would be . when my boot struck moon dust , it flew away in a straight line , a sign of the lighter gravity load , one-sixth that of earth . i did n't anticipate , returning to earth , that america 's triumph was viewed as a success for all humankind . people expressed their collective pride by declaring `` we did it ! '' -- there was an aura of ownership of the achievement . although we can revel in taking rear-view mirror looks at the apollo 11 mission , the urgent need , i believe , is to confront the future . our space program should not focus on getting back to the moon . we have already blazed that trail . apollo was part of a clear , get-there-in-a-hurry , space race strategy . to be blunt , that meant we did n't spend time developing re-usability . it 's time for commercial and international interests to move , beyond discovery , to development . other nations , china in particular , are working toward the exploration and development of the moon with robots and , eventually , crews . providing u.s. support for international lunar development is in our best interest . by participating in a unified , international effort , we avoid an unnecessary race back to the moon and can still participate in lunar science . other u.s. government entities -- the national science foundation and commercial entities -- should take over in moon exploitation and development . it may well be that nasa is not best suited to run this program . exploitation has never been its strong point . it 's true , multiple choices need to be made . we could as a country sit around and do nothing . on the other hand , we could accept the role of space leadership that we carved out for ourselves in the 1960s and 1970s . for america , another destination is calling . america 's longer-term goal should be permanent human presence on mars . the moment to begin could be on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of apollo 11 's touchdown on the moon . we can make a courageous , kennedyesque commitment to america 's future in deep space . the u.s. president could utter these momentous words : `` i believe this nation should commit itself , within two decades , to commencing an america-led , permanent presence on the planet mars . '' we must look to re-establish realistic , but ambitious , longer range and more meaningful exploration goals , and we must issue a call -- with the right guidance and sustained funding -- to a new generation . the next generation of space explorers . again , the apollo moon program provided one small step . other steps lay ahead , strides that take us to the surface of mars . catching the

relies upon to make those decisions  we are left to wonder about the extent to which the department might be undermining its mission to enforce the law and ensure fair and impartial administration of justice  if it bases enforcement actions on a bank s size and economic significance  the justice department would be taking on the role of financial regulator  while we may not agree on the wisdom of allowing bank regulators to designate certain entities as  systemic   congressional intent is clear that such a decision is the purview not of justice but of the financial stability oversight council  we have yet to see any evidence that the department conferred with the oversight council or any financial regulator in determining whether hsbc  or any other institution  was indeed  systemic   were the justice department to maintain a policy of basing enforcement decisions upon an entity s perceived impact on the national economy  one result would be to further entrench  too big to fail   such an arrangement would allow these favored companies to borrow at subsidized rates and to capture marketshare from smaller competitors  ultimately making these same  toobigtofail  companies even bigger   equality under the law  demands that companies are treated similarly under the law  regardless of their size  there can not be a separate justice system for the large and another system for the small  if certain institutions are being provided preferential treatment under the law  then the justice department should publicly acknowledge that that is the case  as well as its reasoning for doing so

s norman s fans include u2  guns n  roses and bob dylan s s more than 300 versions of norman s songs have been recorded by other artists s,1198,54,"1. norman hit the u.s. music scene at a turbulent time for the nation. his first solo album, `` upon this rock, '' came out in late 1969, after he left the band people! the san francisco bay area psychedelic group was fresh off the success of a top 20 hit with a cover of the zombies'`` i love you. '' it was a time when college campuses were erupting in anti-vietnam war protests and the nation was still trying to digest what had just happened that summer at woodstock. as many americans looked for answers, norman offered his faith, a bold decision for an unknown solo artist making his major-label debut. `` it was a pretty gutsy move to sing about jesus on his first record, '' younger brother charles norman said. `` to take a chance on mentioning jesus on a secular record was a pretty important step. '' '' ` upon this rock'was written to stand outside the christian culture, '' larry norman said in an interview with ccm magazine. `` my songs weren't written for christians.... i was saying, ` i'm going to present the gospel, and i'm not going to say it like you want. this album is not for you.''' no small surprise, given that rock music at the time was the soundtrack of the counterculture and was far from the mainstream. a national survey conducted by louis harris and associates in 1966 found that rock 'n' roll was by far the most unpopular music in the country. about 45 percent of adults said they disliked it, with only about 5 percent saying it was their favorite. compare that with today, when nearly two-thirds of those asked in a recent pew resource center poll said they listen to it. being a rocker in the late 1960s wasn't just flying in the face of a conservative christian music industry but mainstream america as well. then there were the lyrics, especially on norman's second solo effort, 1972's `` only visiting this planet. '' there were no happy songs about going to heaven ; the tunes tackled the social issues of the day. norman sang about drugs, politics, racism, sex, venereal disease and jesus -- sometimes in the same song -- getting his music banned from christian bookstores that might have sold it. `` stuff like that shocked uptight christians, '' charles norman said in an npr interview shortly after his brother's death in february 2008 at age 60. `` one of his songs, it's called ` why don't you look into jesus,'one of the lines is : ` you've got gonorrhea on valentine's day -lsb- vd -rsb- and you're still looking for the perfect lay.... why don't you look into jesus? he's got the answer.''' the album also contained what became larry norman's signature song, `` why should the devil have all the good music. '' nearly two decades after its release, `` only visiting this planet, '' helmed by beatles'producer george martin, was recognized as a seminal recording for the genre, voted by ccm magazine in 1990 as the greatest christian album ever recorded. a similar list released in 2001 by ccm, a christian music and lifestyle magazine, put the album at no. 2 all time. u2's `` the joshua tree '' was sixth. norman was inducted into the gospel music hall of fame that same year, along with elvis presley. the accolades came much sooner in the mainstream media. in 1971, billboard magazine called norman `` the most important writer since paul simon, '' while time magazine pegged him as `` probably the top solo artist in the field. '' norman's fans include u2, guns n'roses and bob dylan, according to his brother charles. john mellencamp said he's one, too. british pop star cliff richard made no secret of his admiration. `` when i first became a christian, i hunted around in vain to find christian rock 'n' roll music i could relate to. it just all sounded horrible, '' richard said on `` rockspell, '' a gospel-music-themed bbc television show he hosted in 1986, and on which norman appeared. then he was introduced to norman's music, `` and i just was overjoyed and thrilled, because suddenly i could relate... and there seemed to be a christian who could do it as well, if not better, than the rest of us. '' black francis of the alternative rock group the pixies said norman has been a lifelong influence. `` i listened to his records growing up, and saw him perform many times. in fact, i used to dress up like him ; long blond hair with bangs, sort of a grown-out british invasion look, with black jacket, black shirt, black pants and two-tone black and white cheerleader shoes, '' francis said. `` while larry is always referenced by his christian beliefs, to me he was always an entertainer... humorous, poignant and always rock 'n' roll. his respect for the arena of entertainment is what gave him his power as a performer. '' more than 300 versions of norman's songs have been recorded by other artists, including non-gospel acts as diverse as richard and francis, as well as sammy davis jr., petula clark and tennessee ernie ford. christian music has come a long way in the 40 years since norman pioneered christian rock. `` before larry norman, there was not any christian music industry, '' said shawn mcspadden, manager for switchfoot and the grammy award-winning band third day. but today is a different story, according to figures from the gospel music association. it says 56 million units of christian/gospel music sold in 2008, totaling nearly $ 500 million. `` the christian music industry has been very business-savvy, probably without even realizing it, in that a lot of the artists and bands use their local church as their home base when they begin their careers, '' said bruce burch of the university of georgia's music business school. `` they immediately have fans that are passionate and devout not only about them as a band or artist, but to their message. '' album sales for the genre, during 2008, outsold classical, jazz, new age and latin, according to nielsen soundscan. norman, a hippie musician who set out to sing about his faith, blazed the trail for christian rock.

'' `` there have been lots of civil wars . there 's been lots of societies in turmoil . but this kind of phenomenon where you had crowds peacefully coming into the streets to demand a change in their own contract with their government -- in the arab world proper , this is the first time it 's happened and it 's the first time since 1979 in the middle east , '' cole told cnn last week . he noted that tunisia is the `` most secular country in the arab world . '' its traditions have favored women 's rights and its islamist influence is negligible . tunisia also lacked the oil resources of other arab states and the ethnic divisions seen in other middle eastern countries , which make it harder for opposition movements to unite , he noted . looking at the protests tuesday in cairo , mamoun fandy of the international institute for strategic studies told cnn he was not seeing a `` turning point or tipping point yet . '' noting the strength of the army , he said , `` the egyptian system is too strong and too resilient . '' a key question that will show the potential strength of the demonstrations tuesday is whether hardcore protesters will stay through the night , or whether the rallies will fizzle down , he said . eric trager , a ph.d. candidate in political science at the university of pennsylvania and a former fulbright fellow in egypt , wrote in the atlantic , `` egypt 's liberal activists overwhelmingly come from the wired generation of twitter and facebook , and this makes them optimistic that pro-democratic movements can go viral , even in a political environment as traditionally illiberal as the middle east ... yet egyptian activists face tremendous odds -- in particular , an entrenched dictatorship that is determined to discredit the very idea of domino-effect democratization . '' time.com published a story thursday from writer abigail hauslohner in cairo headlined , `` after tunisia : why egypt is n't ready to have its own revolution . '' some egyptians `` believe the time is now '' for protests to bring about change like in tunisia , and several people in egypt have set themselves on fire or attempted to in recent days -- much like the self-immolation of a young unemployed man in tunisia that sparked protests in that country , she writes . `` but in egypt , it does n't go much deeper than that . '' a greater percentage of egypt 's population than tunisia 's lives below the poverty line , she writes . `` the citizens of egypt regularly complain of a neglectful regime that knows more about torture than it does about public service , and they 're furious with a regime that seems to swallow any domestic profits before they can reach the lower classes . and yet no one predicts a revolutionary reset anytime soon . '' two factors distinguish egypt from tunisia in this respect , hauslohner writes : tunisia 's government spent generously on education , creating a frustrated educated but unemployed population . and in egypt , `` the military stands with '' egyptian president hosni mubarak . time.com is a partner of cnn.com . writing in newsweek , journalist mike giglio suggested the `` upcoming protest in cairo could mark the beginning of another upheaval . '' `` tuesday will be the first real test of whether the revolution is contagious , '' he wrote in a story published monday . many protesters believe their demonstrations will prove to have far more power than naysayers suggest . a facebook page that has served to help organize tuesday 's protests in cairo says , `` many young egyptians are now fed up with the inhuman treatment they face on a daily basis in streets , police stations and everywhere ... egyptians are aspiring to the day when egypt has its freedom and dignity back , the day when the current 30 years long emergency martial law ends and when egyptians can freely elect their true representatives .
