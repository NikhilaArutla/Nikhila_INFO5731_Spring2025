LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.",6,1,beautiful film preachy,margot best shes given film disappointing marketed fun quirky satire homages movies started way ended overdramatized speeches ending clearly tried make audience feel something left everyone feeling confused say im crotchety old man im woman im pretty sure im movies target audience saddest part parents kids theater victims poor marketing kids movie overall humor fun occasion film beautiful look whole concept falls apart second half film becomes pity party strong woman,beauti film preachi,margot best she given film disappoint market fun quirki satir homag movi start way end overdramat speech end clearli tri make audienc feel someth left everyon feel confus say im crotcheti old man im woman im pretti sure im movi target audienc saddest part parent kid theater victim poor market kid movi overal humor fun occas film beauti look whole concept fall apart second half film becom piti parti strong woman,beautiful film preachy,margot best shes given film disappointing marketed fun quirky satire homage movie started way ended overdramatized speech ending clearly tried make audience feel something left everyone feeling confused say im crotchety old man im woman im pretty sure im movie target audience saddest part parent kid theater victim poor marketing kid movie overall humor fun occasion film beautiful look whole concept fall apart second half film becomes pity party strong woman

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point. Patriarchy may give men privilege but it ultimately hurts them, too - pressuring them to conform to a rigid idea of manhood and silencing their self-expression.I am living for the fact that this movie is unapologetic about showing the absurdity of it all. I would have given it a 10 if it weren't for the cringe worthy Ken dance number. It was the only weak part of the movie.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,1,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask
lokicola,OVERHYPED,"This is a movie that was way overhyped. Everyone kept saying it was so amazing, but when I finally go to watch it, it was not at all what I thought it was going to be. The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.I didn't care for how they portrayed Ken. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down.

heatherhilgers,It could have been so much better...,"The film's universe and settings are fantastic. The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie. Instead, we're left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women, in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film.Instead of seeing a light, fun film, I saw a rather heavy-handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy.It's a real shame, because the film's potential is pretty amazing.

hamsterination,Well this really did come as a surprise.,"It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,1,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,1,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point. Patriarchy may give men privilege but it ultimately hurts them, too - pressuring them to conform to a rigid idea of manhood and silencing their self-expression.I am living for the fact that this movie is unapologetic about showing the absurdity of it all. I would have given it a 10 if it weren't for the cringe worthy Ken dance number. It was the only weak part of the movie.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,2,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,2,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world

Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,2,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point. Patriarchy may give men privilege but it ultimately hurts them, too - pressuring them to conform to a rigid idea of manhood and silencing their self-expression.I am living for the fact that this movie is unapologetic about showing the absurdity of it all. I would have given it a 10 if it weren't for the cringe worthy Ken dance number. It was the only weak part of the movie.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,3,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks.

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,3,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,3,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point. Patriarchy may give men privilege but it ultimately hurts them, too - pressuring them to conform to a rigid idea of manhood and silencing their self-expression.I am living for the fact that this movie is unapologetic about showing the absurdity of it all. I would have given it a 10 if it weren't for the cringe worthy Ken dance number. It was the only weak part of the movie.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,4,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,4,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,4,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point. Patriarchy may give men privilege but it ultimately hurts them, too - pressuring them to conform to a rigid idea of manhood and silencing their self-expression.I am living for the fact that this movie is unapologetic about showing the absurdity of it all. I would have given it a 10 if it weren't for the cringe worthy Ken dance number. It was the only weak part of the movie.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,5,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down.

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,5,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,5,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.",6,6,beautiful film preachy,margot best shes given film disappointing marketed fun quirky satire homages movies started way ended overdramatized speeches ending clearly tried make audience feel something left everyone feeling confused say im crotchety old man im woman im pretty sure im movies target audience saddest part parents kids theater victims poor marketing kids movie overall humor fun occasion film beautiful look whole concept falls apart second half film becomes pity party strong woman,beauti film preachi,margot best she given film disappoint market fun quirki satir homag movi start way end overdramat speech end clearli tri make audienc feel someth left everyon feel confus say im crotcheti old man im woman im pretti sure im movi target audienc saddest part parent kid theater victim poor market kid movi overal humor fun occas film beauti look whole concept fall apart second half film becom piti parti strong woman,beautiful film preachy,margot best shes given film disappointing marketed fun quirky satire homage movie started way ended overdramatized speech ending clearly tried make audience feel something left everyone feeling confused say im crotchety old man im woman im pretty sure im movie target audience saddest part parent kid theater victim poor marketing kid movie overall humor fun occasion film beautiful look whole concept fall apart second half film becomes pity party strong woman

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,6,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,6,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,6,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,7,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,7,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,7,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,8,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,8,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,8,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.",6,9,beautiful film preachy,margot best shes given film disappointing marketed fun quirky satire homages movies started way ended overdramatized speeches ending clearly tried make audience feel something left everyone feeling confused say im crotchety old man im woman im pretty sure im movies target audience saddest part parents kids theater victims poor marketing kids movie overall humor fun occasion film beautiful look whole concept falls apart second half film becomes pity party strong woman,beauti film preachi,margot best she given film disappoint market fun quirki satir homag movi start way end overdramat speech end clearli tri make audienc feel someth left everyon feel confus say im crotcheti old man im woman im pretti sure im movi target audienc saddest part parent kid theater victim poor market kid movi overal humor fun occas film beauti look whole concept fall apart second half film becom piti parti strong woman,beautiful film preachy,margot best shes given film disappointing marketed fun quirky satire homage movie started way ended overdramatized speech ending clearly tried make audience feel something left everyone feeling confused say im crotchety old man im woman im pretty sure im movie target audience saddest part parent kid theater victim poor marketing kid movie overall humor fun occasion film beautiful look whole concept fall apart second half film becomes pity party strong woman

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,9,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,9,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,9,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.",6,10,beautiful film preachy,margot best shes given film disappointing marketed fun quirky satire homages movies started way ended overdramatized speeches ending clearly tried make audience feel something left everyone feeling confused say im crotchety old man im woman im pretty sure im movies target audience saddest part parents kids theater victims poor marketing kids movie overall humor fun occasion film beautiful look whole concept falls apart second half film becomes pity party strong woman,beauti film preachi,margot best she given film disappoint market fun quirki satir homag movi start way end overdramat speech end clearli tri make audienc feel someth left everyon feel confus say im crotcheti old man im woman im pretti sure im movi target audienc saddest part parent kid theater victim poor market kid movi overal humor fun occas film beauti look whole concept fall apart second half film becom piti parti strong woman,beautiful film preachy,margot best shes given film disappointing marketed fun quirky satire homage movie started way ended overdramatized speech ending clearly tried make audience feel something left everyone feeling confused say im crotchety old man im woman im pretty sure im movie target audience saddest part parent kid theater victim poor marketing kid movie overall humor fun occasion film beautiful look whole concept fall apart second half film becomes pity party strong woman

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,10,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks.

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

hamsterination,Well this really did come as a surprise.,"It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,10,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,10,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,11,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

hamsterination,Well this really did come as a surprise.,"It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,11,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,11,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,12,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks.

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

hamsterination,Well this really did come as a surprise.,"It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,12,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,12,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,13,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks.

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,13,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,13,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,14,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks.

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,14,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,14,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,15,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,15,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,15,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,16,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks.

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,16,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,16,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,17,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,17,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,17,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,18,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks.

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,18,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,18,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,19,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,19,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,19,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,20,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks.

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,20,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,20,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,21,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,21,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,21,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,22,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,22,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,22,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,23,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,23,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,23,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,24,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,24,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,24,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,25,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,25,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,25,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,26,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks.

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,26,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,26,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,27,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks.

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,27,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,27,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,28,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,28,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,28,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,29,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,29,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,29,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,30,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,30,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,30,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,31,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,31,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,31,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,32,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,32,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,32,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,33,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,33,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,33,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,34,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,34,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,34,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,35,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,35,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,35,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,36,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,36,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,36,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,37,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,37,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,37,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,38,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,38,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,38,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,39,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,39,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,39,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,40,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks.

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,40,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,40,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,41,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,41,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,41,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,42,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,42,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,42,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique.

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,43,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie.

That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this.

G-Joshua-Benjamin,Disappointing: terribly preachy and horrendous script. Great cast.,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are really great in their roles of Barbie and Kent. Gosling is specially hilarious. I expected a funny, cool, deep and entertaining movie, but I was highly disappointed. The movie is so terribly preachy that ends being an embarrassment. We (the audience) have brains, so, please, preach somewhere else. Furthermore, this is a movie to divide, not to unite. And I'm a woman. The script of the movie is horrendous and the direction is plain bad. There are some great actresses that have too little to say, like Emma Mackey, and that's a pity. Overall: a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity. 3/10 (1 point for Margot Robbie, 1 point for Ryan Gosling, and 1 point for the art direction (super tacky and pinky, as Barbie's world).",3,43,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great roles barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy ends embarrassment audience brains please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actresses little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world,disappoint terribl preachi horrend script great cast,margot robbi ryan gosl realli great role barbi kent gosl special hilari expect funni cool deep entertain movi highli disappoint movi terribl preachi end embarrass audienc brain pleas preach somewher els furthermor movi divid unit im woman script movi horrend direct plain bad great actress littl say like emma mackey that piti overal huge disappoint miss opportun point margot robbi point ryan gosl point art direct super tacki pinki barbi world,disappointing terribly preachy horrendous script great cast,margot robbie ryan gosling really great role barbie kent gosling specially hilarious expected funny cool deep entertaining movie highly disappointed movie terribly preachy end embarrassment audience brain please preach somewhere else furthermore movie divide unite im woman script movie horrendous direction plain bad great actress little say like emma mackey thats pity overall huge disappointment missed opportunity point margot robbie point ryan gosling point art direction super tacky pinky barbies world
antoniatejedabarros,Ken out of ten,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

sophiaaven,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",6,43,fun film whose script falls,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent hes given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynics perhaps realists argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie dolls attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercuts credibility message somewhatthe movie starts well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many winks audience however progresses commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe designs standout think kids love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaws likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kids youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbi perform perfect no actor couldv embodi charact well howev ryan gosl filmsteal often forget comed talent he given lot room flex cleverli execut matchbox twenti joke particularli memorablewhil cynic perhap realist argu film primarili market vehicl sell barbi doll attempt carri moral messag howev commerci aspect movi undercut credibl messag somewhatth movi start well smartli selfawar offer tongueincheek critiqu mani wink audienc howev progress commentari femin patriarchi becom heavyhand especi dialogueheavi third act weigh overal narrativeth set wardrob design standout think kid love part alon even humor social commentari go headsoveral fun film without flaw like spark discuss due blunt societ commentari your look visual impress movi entertain kid your will enjoy without analyz messag deepli enjoy watch,fun film whose script fall,margot robbies performance perfect no actor couldve embodied character well however ryan gosling filmstealer often forget comedic talent he given lot room flex cleverly executed matchbox twenty joke particularly memorablewhile cynic perhaps realist argue film primarily marketing vehicle sell barbie doll attempt carry moral message however commercial aspect movie undercut credibility message somewhatthe movie start well smartly selfaware offering tongueincheek critique many wink audience however progress commentary feminism patriarchy becomes heavyhanded especially dialogueheavy third act weighs overall narrativethe set wardrobe design standout think kid love part alone even humor social commentary go headsoverall fun film without flaw likely spark discussion due blunt societal commentary youre looking visually impressive movie entertain kid youre willing enjoy without analyzing message deeply enjoyable watch

LoveofLegacy,"Beautiful film, but so preachy","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie.

L3MM3,People are missing the point,"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point. Patriarchy may give men privilege but it ultimately hurts them, too - pressuring them to conform to a rigid idea of manhood and silencing their self-expression.I am living for the fact that this movie is unapologetic about showing the absurdity of it all. I would have given it a 10 if it weren't for the cringe worthy Ken dance number. It was the only weak part of the movie.

coxaneesa,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.",6,44,could great nd half brings,quality humor writing movie fun quirky unique get weeds try explore deeper themes movie miss middle expositional phase movie must say borethe movie close great incapable delivering message without character literally give speech worth dialoguewhat could great satire began cleverly funny movie turned preachy moralizing movie end guess charm first half movie made shortcomings,could great nd half bring,qualiti humor write movi fun quirki uniqu get weed tri explor deeper theme movi miss middl exposit phase movi must say boreth movi close great incap deliv messag without charact liter give speech worth dialoguewhat could great satir began cleverli funni movi turn preachi moral movi end guess charm first half movi made shortcom,could great nd half brings,quality humor writing movie fun quirky unique get weed try explore deeper theme movie miss middle expositional phase movie must say borethe movie close great incapable delivering message without character literally give speech worth dialoguewhat could great satire began cleverly funny movie turned preachy moralizing movie end guess charm first half movie made shortcoming

herrcarter-92161,Strong Start... and That's It,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",6,44,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part songs catchy performances solid type characters portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moments barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient hes ever life also share couple learning growth moments thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge things mess make intentional meaningful steps get us closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversies engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated forms media entertainment recently fact embraces much scene man walks behind barbie slaps backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film views worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issues real world offer foster ideas change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask,strong start that,walk theatr think yeah good time movi day went kind ok kebab probabl wasnt good ideath film stun product design creativ margot robbi perfectli cast stereotyp barbi part song catchi perform solid type charact portrayingwhen strip away outsid world messag barbi ken poignant moment barbi realis she perfect she made believ ken receiv first modicum acknowledg sentient he ever life also share coupl learn growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hope someth would actual enlighten audienc acknowledg thing mess make intent meaning step get us closer understand equal barbi brand histori controversi engrain cultur movi potenti chang perspect world futur could that lot pressur one film knowhowev film absolut immun notsosubtl messag permeat form media entertain recent fact embrac much scene man walk behind barbi slap backsid broad daylight crowd space front boyfriend kind portray men appear film view worldmayb kind overt comic depict men world gener allow get movi kind enjoy upon reflect realis kind yuckbarbi rare opportun film experi highlight issu real world offer foster idea chang instead receiv divis meanspirit attack half human popul well anyon think famili accept path life also flat feet celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film serious mayb youll last posit memori see moviebut need enjoy someth need ask,strong start thats,walked theatre thinking yeah good time movie day went kind ok kebab probably wasnt good ideathe film stunning production design creativity margot robbie perfectly cast stereotypical barbie part song catchy performance solid type character portrayingwhen strip away outside world messaging barbie ken poignant moment barbie realising shes perfect shes made believe ken receives first modicum acknowledgement sentient he ever life also share couple learning growth moment thought would pay end filmi dont know hoping something would actually enlighten audience acknowledge thing mess make intentional meaningful step get u closer understanding equality barbie brand history controversy engrained culture movie potential change perspective world future could thats lot pressure one film knowhowever film absolutely immune notsosubtle messaging permeated form medium entertainment recently fact embrace much scene man walk behind barbie slap backside broad daylight crowded space front boyfriend kind portrayal men appears film view worldmaybe kind overt comical depiction men world generally allowed get movie kind enjoy upon reflection realise kind yuckbarbie rare opportunity film experience highlighted issue real world offer foster idea change instead receive divisive meanspirited attack half human population well anyone thinking family acceptable path life also flat foot celluliteif kind switch brain hour bit dont take film seriously maybe youll lasting positive memory seeing moviebut need enjoy something need ask
lokicola,OVERHYPED,"This is a movie that was way overhyped. Everyone kept saying it was so amazing, but when I finally go to watch it, it was not at all what I thought it was going to be. The storyline was not good. It was a basic and corny storyline, in my opinion.I didn't care for how they portrayed Ken. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor, but he is not a good representation of Ken when it comes to how he looks and how the actual Ken doll looks. The way he acted as Ken was not that good either, but he didn't get much help from the writers for the way they wrote his part. The movie had so much potential, but was definitely a let down. One positive is that it had some funny parts, but it could of been written much better and could of had a much better storyline!!",6,44,overhyped,movie way overhyped everyone kept saying amazing finally go watch thought going storyline good basic corny storyline opinioni didnt care portrayed ken ryan gosling amazing actor good representation ken comes looks actual ken doll looks way acted ken good either didnt get much help writers way wrote part movie much potential definitely let one positive funny parts could written much better could much better storyline,overhyp,movi way overhyp everyon kept say amaz final go watch thought go storylin good basic corni storylin opinioni didnt care portray ken ryan gosl amaz actor good represent ken come look actual ken doll look way act ken good either didnt get much help writer way wrote part movi much potenti definit let one posit funni part could written much better could much better storylin,overhyped,movie way overhyped everyone kept saying amazing finally go watch thought going storyline good basic corny storyline opinioni didnt care portrayed ken ryan gosling amazing actor good representation ken come look actual ken doll look way acted ken good either didnt get much help writer way wrote part movie much potential definitely let one positive funny part could written much better could much better storyline
